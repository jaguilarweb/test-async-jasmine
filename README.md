## Instructions
This projects is already set up preconfigured with TypeScript and Jasmine.

In the index.ts file in the src folder, you will see one complete function, and space to create 2 other functions.

In the indexSpec.ts files in src, you will see 2 specs and a space to create 1 more.

Your job is to look at the specs available, and write functions that pass on the index.ts file. Then, create the missing spec for the getRegionCountries function.

This assignment uses axios to get data from the restcountries.com api. If you are unfamiliar with axios, follow the structure of the function getRegionCountries. Make sure to visit one of the routes to see how the JSON data is supplied from the API.

Make sure to run the test script when complete to ensure that the project builds and that all tests pass. View the package.json file to see available scripts.
